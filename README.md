# How to add surface values to GemPy v3 models
This short howto demontrates adding surface values such as seismic velocities, density, porosity to surface layers in GemPy v3. This functionality was directly available in previous versions of GemPy.
This howto came about implementing an excellent tutorial created by Ed Caunt for transform 2021 - [Creating seismic synthetics with Devito and GemPy](https://github.com/devitocodes/transform2021/blob/main/creating_synthetics.ipynb).
All background and setup information can be found there and all credit to Ed Caunt.
